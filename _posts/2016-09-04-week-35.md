* Babai and Frankl: using the Frankl-Wilson inequality for sets with
  restricted intersections for constructing Ramsey graphs and a lower
  bound on the chromatic number of the unit distance graph.
* Probabilistic method: algorithmic Lovasz local lemma. Applications on
  hashing and low-degre polynomials.
